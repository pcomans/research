Atlas shrugged


USes alot of the same similar advance words like gayity, shrugged, etc

Most fictional atories in this world portrays the world with evil right winged villans who owns too mich and despoces the common man, in atlas shrugged this is flipped and its the left side pf politics that is the villans. Sneaky, conivng , deciting villans that only car about the people and that noone should be able to own or have any ability better than others. And the right side is criminalozed and depocted as egocentric.

The book is a noce catalysator for thonking outside the norm of your own political domain. Since its so pf pivot. Its hard to agree with the extreme socialism enforced by the storrys villans but at the same time its hard too agree withe the right wingged hetos of the storry too, since you sort of know that if given the chance they to would rule with limitless sceuteny of their opposition.

In my opinion its a nice political thought experiment, and makes you think long and hard about left vs right. Is there ever an equlibrium? 

Pro
Provocs new thought

Con
Very long
A little repetitive
