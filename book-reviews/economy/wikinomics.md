Wikinomics

Summary
Discusses effects of business transitioning into the post industrial era where crowd sourcing thrives, mostly around the positice effects. Its an unbias book

The book is like an opensource project with all its flaws, no clear architecture, naivly built, naivly argumented has a very utopian look on crowd sourcing, very unbias

Only makes the connection to comunism once and just as a comment.


Pro
Has some good points on why usin third party r & d but doest argue why reinventing the wheel is key to development
