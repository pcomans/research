Straight A student

The intro talks about how the book seperates from other study guide books, that its made from the students point of view, and that its not about about bruteforce studying by sacrifising sleep or recreational time. Craming in all nighters etc.

Psudo workig
Many students think they do real wprk by studdying 8 hours straight, bring redbulls to all night readings right before exams etc. Non grond straight a students avoid psudo working at all cost

Time managment
Having a realistic sense of time is arguably themost important trait you can have as a student. Schedual tasks froma calender in the moring leave plenty pf ti e for breaks 1 hour not a stressfull 20min one. Keep the time slots less than 1,5 hours group many smaller tasks into one timeslot, and quit well before bedtime tp have time to relax and unwind. The brain needs breaks to åerform at peak. All this to avoid all nigthers and sub par performance at crucial times. Timetabiling your tasks will also help avoid procrastinating.

Handwritten todo of the day
Keep a small piece of paper with the task of the day and time slots to complete them, also keep a things to remeber section. The next morning transdere the remaining tasks and ps. Things to your callender.

Food
Drink often, breaks to the bathroom onøy gives your body variation from sitting still.
Eat healthy, fruite veggies, nuts, avoid sugar that gives you a short burst of energy
Avoid to much coffinated drinks
Eat regulary to avoid low energy periods

Procastination
There will be a few days were you have to pull all day marathons to just grind through an asignment. Its important that these days are planed and not a result of procastination.

When to study
Short burst of 45 min  to 1.5h. If you have an enpty pocket of time pull out a continuas studdy and read it.

Where to study
In isolation, find spots that are calm and empty.

How much time to spend
For maximum retention spend 40- 50 min
There are people that devote their entire life tor the grind
If you cut class it will take twice as mich time studdying to cath up on the missed class

Note taking
Non tech classes resolce around three things. Question, evidence and conclusion. Its all about the big ideas sourinding different subjects.
Structure what the professor says in class the same way. You cant write down all he says anyway. Rewiew your notes after class. To further cement the lecture to your mind.
Technocal classes needs detailed note taking also ask questions or make question marks on stuff that is unclear

Reading everything is imposible, figuring out what is mpst importnt is the trickyåart
Readong that makes an argument is more imp than reading that is about a person or an event which is. Ore imp than reading that provides context.
But most importantly is reading favored sources reading material that shows up frequently or is underlined by a årpffessor.

Favored sources
If its hard to determin what the favoured source is look at the title of the class, the favored sources should have related names to the subject. The favored sourxes will also be close to what the teacher emphazises in class. Un favored sources can be skimmed with some aditional note taking on imp parts.

Note taking on favored sources
Can be destilled ino three parts a question, evdence, and conclusion. The question can usually be found in the title or the first few sentences. Next look for the authers conclusion thesis statement, this is perhaps the most difficult part because autheres like complexity in their conclusion. Its usually hidden in the forst few paragraphs or the last few paragrafs where its more refined after all the evidence supoorting the conclusion.

Technical problem sets
Solve it by first spending a small chunk pf time on it to familiraize yourself with it then, let it rest if its to hard to solve straoght away. Problems that are creative pf nature are seldom solved by brute force and big time slots. Lef the problem simmernberween orher acticities. When ot comes to you write the whole thing down perfectly. 

Define the challenge
What material seems to be key to the exam.
What type of questions will be asked (earlier exams can help answer this)
Will texh exams allow formulas
Will it be an open not or book exam
How much time and will it be challenfinf or normal

Previews exams are great for reciewing your skill level. They are also great for disrilling out the favoured sources

Memorization
Simply use flash cards, problem on one side answer on the other. Memorie one or two hours max per day. And spread the memorization period out. Do t memorize for  8 hours straight, it wont stick.

Dont organize and study on the same day

Imprinting knowlege
For tech courses : The best way to imprint knowlege is to review it and then try to explain and reproduce it in your own words or in writing (unaided) after this is complete the knowlege is not going anywhere
Non tech courses: use thevquiz and recall method here aswell you have formated your notes on all the source material in question evidence conclusion so just try to reproduce the big ideas out loud or in writing. If you stumble upon things you cant reproduce make a mark of it and review your notes and then reproduce that single part. 

No clue questions on the exams (academic disaster asurance)
They happen, but they can be tackled by making all the obscure questions that arose throughout the semester answered when they show up, and make use of the pre exam review sesion often offered. 


One the exam
Divid your time on num of questions minus 10min use the extra ten min here and rhere dubble xhexkinf your answers. Review all the questions in. 5 min. Start with the easiest questions first, skip any questions that doesnt come to you right away. And return to it later

Exam questions
Usually you can distill 3 or 4 mini questions from a single exam question, write down and underline this questions, use the margins on the exam paper to outline in points what you know of these questions. Number the points in the order you want to present them in your essay. After exam completion and you still have time recheck your work. Many times there will be a small mistake in tech courses for instance. Tech exams are usually graded on a curve so top 15 % gets an A, staying cool ons harder than usual questions is key.since everyone els also will find this question tricky.

Writing an essay or paper
Divide it into 3 parts, sifitng through exisiting arguments, forming your own argument, communicating your arguments clearly

Right mindset
To put your self in the right mind set pick up atalntic monthly new yorker or harpers, read some high level articles and absorbe some writers skills,(good one)

Seperate writing processes
Sepperate the research part 2 weeks worth, and writing part 2 days wprth, and edoting part 2 days worth. The idea here is that by finishi g the research part first you wont have to constantly go back to your sources and research again. And you will have a deep understanding of the topic. In contrast to many otherstudent does this by doing a 1 week researxh wroting frenzy. Ending in sleep deprivation and pleary eyes.

Editing
When editing a paper, run many passes over it a vocal reading pass, spellprofing pass argument adjustment pass

Split efforts into chunks
Researching for 8 hours straight will yield half the result as 4 chunks of 2 hour research. Seperate reading from thinking and thibking from writing.

Study and work in isolation.
The importance of quite and working in Isolation is repeat more than 20 times.
It seems to be the key to super concentration. Will this translate to a real college sitution or even the workplace later in life. Possibly this they key to most things effective, also rwgularry swichigng the isolation nook, so not to feel lonley. Cuibicles forbid.

Pro
This study guide book is based around the fact that long study sesions should be avoided at all cost, short incremental bursts of studdying will keep your mind energy at peak. And a possitive by product of this burst type of studdying is that you keep alot of material simmering in your head, overtime forging a strong bond since you think about it mpre often than not. The book has many good instudctions and includes examples of in use situations.

Con
Efficiency is good but in the future efficient grinding will be the norm, if you want be stand out, you probably need to have excessive empathic, creative and engineering abilities combined with efficient grinding. Since all slabs of efficency  in our sociaty will be rare.

Conclusion
All in all i think the way this books teachces you how to study enables you to be happy, no all nighters that zaps mpral and motivation, planing generates a sence of control, and eating right and working out makes your body healthy.
